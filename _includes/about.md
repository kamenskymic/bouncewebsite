Bounce Security was founded by Avi Douglen, a leading security professional with decades of experience. 

Bounce Security consults on software security to development teams of all sizes, working with them to integrate security practices into their process. We've worked with some of the biggest organizations on their application security, as well as small startups. We prefer to work directly with development teams, often providing training on secure coding and other security topics. Software security, development processes, identity architecture, and access management are our specialties. 

We bring this technical expertise to your table and merge it with a business perspective to ensure you get the maximum bang for your security buck.
