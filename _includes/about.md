AviD is a security architect and software developer, and has been leading development teams in building secure products for over 20 years. As a systems developer and security consultant over the years, Avi has amassed much technical knowledge, both low- and high-level, and a very good understanding of enterprise security needs at the business level. His research interests include efficient security engineering, usable security, and scaling enterprise security systems.   

AviD is a leader of the OWASP Israel chapter, created the popular AppSecIL security conference, and is co-founder and leader of the OWASP Threat Modeling Project. He is also a community moderator on https://security.StackExchange.com/, a volunteer high school tech teacher, and a frequent speaker at industry conferences, such as OWASP, RSA, BSides, and DevSecCon.

Bounce Security consults on software security to development teams of all sizes, working with them to integrate security practices into their process. We've worked with some of the biggest organizations on their application security, as well as small startups. We prefer to work directly with development teams, often providing training on secure coding and other security topics. Software security, development processes, identity architecture, and access management are our specialties. 

We bring this technical expertise to your table and merge it with a business perspective to ensure you get the maximum bang for your security buck.
