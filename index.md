At Bounce Security, we care about doing security the right way.   
For us, that means focusing on protecting what *really* matters. Instead of wasting your limited resources on generic, so-called "best practices", draining your developers' cycles or squandering budget on expensive and ineffective consultants.  

That is why we've developed our "**Value Driven Security**" approach, to save you time and money, and to enable a more efficient security process.   
Having strong technical background and an intelligent risk analysis framework in place not only helps discover security risks, but also allows us to make pragmatic decisions and recommend *against* spending on risks that do not affect your bottom line.
